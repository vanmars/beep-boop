# _Beep Boop Machine_

#### _A web app project to practice loops (for Epicodus), 21 August 2020_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

This is a simple form that queries users for a number and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the inputted number with the following exceptions:

* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

Additionally, as more numbers are inputted, the program displays a list of all previous values.

## Specifiations
1. Behavior: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number.
* Input: "thirty"
* Output: "Please enter a number, and use digits rather than letters."

2. Behavior: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number.
* Input: "4"
* Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"

3. Behavior: If a number in the range of outputted numbers contains a 1, the program replaces that outputted number in the range with "Beep!"
* Input: "4"
* Output: "0, Beep!, 2, 3, 4"

4. Behavior: If the user's inputted number contains a 2, the program returns "Boop!"
* Input: "4"
* Output: "0, Beep!, Boop!, 3, 4"

5. Behavior: If the user's inputted number contains a 3, the program returns "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* Input: "4"
* Output: "0, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my neighbor?, 4"

6. Behavior: If the user selects to return numbers in decreasing order, the program returns a range of numbers 
(that includes the exceptions above for numbers with 3, 2, and 1) beginning with the inputted number through 0.
* Input: "4" "Decreasing"
* Output: "4, Won't you be my neighbor?, Boop!, Beep!, 0"
