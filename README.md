#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

This is a simple form that queries users for a number and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the inputted number with the following exceptions:

* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

Additionally, as more numbers are inputted, the program displays a list of all previous values.
